# Machine-Learning-based-Clothing-Comfort-Prediction
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict clothing comfort based on environmental conditions and clothing properties. The goal is to provide personalized recommendations to improve the user's overall comfort.
For this project we will be applying machine learning models (both regression and classification) to the dataset which contains information about various individuals, their clothing, and its properties along with other atmospheric elements such as temperature, pressure humidity etc. The users also provided feedback on if they feel cold or not.
